# SpeaKcal
SpeaKcal is a calorie tracking app with speech-to-text and AI photo recognition functions included.

## Installation
This app was made in Android Studio and that is how we are running it so far. To get this on your device you can open up the latest branch in Android Studio 
and from there you can run the app which will install it on your Android Device.

## Usage
There are a number of dependencies and imports that we have included which may not allow the app to run when first opened, but you can fix this by pressing the fifth
button from the top right corner of the menu in Android Studio which syncs the project with gradle files. When hovering over the button it should show the following text
```
Sync Project with Gradle Files Ctrl+Shift+O
```
then there should be no issues running and installing the app.
